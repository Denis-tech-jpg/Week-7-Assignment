## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Enter your name** — it's stored in the browser's localStorage.
2. **Toggle the theme** — your theme preference is remembered.
3. **Click "Highlight Photo"** — triggers a zoom animation effect.
4. On page reload, the app welcomes you back by name and remembers your selected theme.
